React Native Fiber is a starter kit for React Native. Fiber is based on the UI Kit of the same name from Framer and is focused on animations. You can use them as turn key solutions for your next project. This project has been rewritten using es6 with flow annotations for type checking. Fiber can easily be customized and is built on with NativeBase and react-navigation.

with the [expo client](https://expo.io/tools#mobile), you can try the starter kit by using this [link](https://expo.io/@market_geekyants/projects/react-native-fiber-firebase)
